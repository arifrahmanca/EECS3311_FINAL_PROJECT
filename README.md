# EECS3311_FINAL_PROJECT
The nations of Earth are in desperate need of a galaxy exploration simulator to prepare a new generation
for deep space exploration. The combined effects of the hole in the ozone layer, global warming, nuclear
catastrophes and the fear that ABBA might still reform have inspired action. At long last, our planet has
finally mounted a concerted effort not merely to find out if "anyone’s out there", but whether or not we
can join them. As such, they require a simulator to train space explorers to search different sectors of our
galaxy containing stars of the same type as our own sun. These stars, known as "Yellow Dwarfs", are
believed to hold the best hope of discovering planets that support life - at least "as we know it". The
explorer’s mission is to see if such stars have any planets orbiting them. If a planet is discovered, the
explorer can land on the planet and conduct experiments to determine if life is supportable (rock and
atmospheric sampling for oxygen, carbon or water, existence of Pizza Huts, and so on). The game is won
and the simulation ends when a planet capable of supporting life is discovered.
